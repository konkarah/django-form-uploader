# Dynamic Forms Platform

A full-stack platform for creating, managing, and submitting dynamic forms with real-time notifications and role-based access control.

1. Flexible Field Types

Text Input
Textarea
Number
Email
Phone
Date
Datetime
Dropdown (Single/Multiple)
Checkbox
Radio Buttons

3. Client Experience

4. Notification System

Email notifications via SendGrid
In-app notifications
Admin dashboard alerts
Submission status tracking

5. Analytics Dashboard

Design Decisions
1. Field Evolution Strategy
Using JSON schema with versioning to handle field changes:

Each form stores its schema version
New submissions use current schema
Old submissions maintain compatibility
Gradual migration path for field updates

2. Validation Engine
Predefined validation types stored in field configuration:

Built-in validations (required, email, phone, etc.)
Custom regex patterns
Conditional validations based on other field values
File type and size restrictions

3. Draft System

Auto-save mechanism using local storage + API sync
Unique draft identifiers per user/form combination
Cleanup mechanism for abandoned drafts
Resume functionality with progress tracking

4. Scalability Considerations

Paginated APIs for large datasets
Indexed database queries
Async task processing for heavy operations
Modular component architecture
Caching strategy for frequently accessed data

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project consists of two main components:

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.10+
- Redis (for Celery tasks)

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```sh
cd my-project

Install dependencies:

shnpm install

Create .env.local and configure environment variables:

envNEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret

Start the development server:

shnpm run dev
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

shcd backend

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

shpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

shpip install -r requirements.txt

Create .env file with required variables:

envSECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

Run migrations:

shpython manage.py migrate

Create a superuser (optional):

shpython manage.py createsuperuser

Start the development server:

shpython manage.py runserver
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000
Celery Setup
In separate terminal windows:

Start Redis:

shredis-server

Start Celery worker:

shcd backend
celery -A config worker --loglevel=info

Start Celery beat (for scheduled tasks):

shcelery -A config beat --loglevel=info

üîê Authentication
Clerk Integration
The platform uses Clerk for authentication:

Frontend: Clerk provides UI components and hooks (useAuth, useUser)
Backend: Validates Clerk JWT tokens via custom authentication class
User Sync: Users are automatically created in Django when they sign in via Clerk

API Authentication
All protected endpoints require a JWT token in the Authorization header:
Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt_token>

üë• User Roles
The platform supports two user roles:

Admin ‚Äî Full access to all forms, submissions, and analytics
Client ‚Äî Can view assigned forms and manage own submissions

To set a user as admin, update their role in Django:
pythonpython manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
>>> User = get_user_model()
>>> user = User.objects.get(email='admin@example.com')
>>> user.role = 'admin'
>>> user.save()

üîî Notifications
The platform sends notifications for:

New form submissions (to admins)
Form review/approval (to submitters)
Status changes

Notifications are delivered via:

In-app notifications (real-time)
Email (via SendGrid)


üê≥ Docker Deployment (Optional)
A docker-compose.yml file is included for containerized deployment:
shdocker-compose up -d
This will start:

Django application
Celery worker
Celery beat
Redis

CORS: Configure CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in Django settings for cross-origin requests
File Storage: Files are stored locally by default; configure AWS S3 for production
Database: SQLite is used for development; use PostgreSQL for production
Email: Configure SendGrid API key for email notifications
