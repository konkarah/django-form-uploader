- Python 3.10+
- Redis (for Celery tasks)

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```sh
cd my-project

Install dependencies:

shnpm install

Create .env.local and configure environment variables:

envNEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret

Start the development server:

shnpm run dev
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

shcd backend

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

shpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:

shpip install -r requirements.txt

Create .env file with required variables:

envSECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DEBUG=True
ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_key
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com

Run migrations:

shpython manage.py migrate

Create a superuser (optional):

shpython manage.py createsuperuser

Start the development server:

shpython manage.py runserver
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000
Celery Setup
In separate terminal windows:

Start Redis:

shredis-server

Start Celery worker:

shcd backend
celery -A config worker --loglevel=info

Start Celery beat (for scheduled tasks):

shcelery -A config beat --loglevel=info

üîê Authentication
Clerk Integration
The platform uses Clerk for authentication:

Frontend: Clerk provides UI components and hooks (useAuth, useUser)
Backend: Validates Clerk JWT tokens via custom authentication class
User Sync: Users are automatically created in Django when they sign in via Clerk

API Authentication
All protected endpoints require a JWT token in the Authorization header:
Authorization: Bearer <clerk_jwt_token>

üë• User Roles
The platform supports two user roles:

Client ‚Äî Can view assigned forms and manage own submissions

To set a user as admin, update their role in Django:
pythonpython manage.py shell
>>> from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
>>> User = get_user_model()
>>> user = User.objects.get(email='admin@example.com')
>>> user.role = 'admin'
>>> user.save()

üîî Notifications
The platform sends notifications for:

New form submissions (to admins)
Form review/approval (to submitters)
Status changes

Notifications are delivered via:

In-app notifications (real-time)
Email (via SendGrid)


üê≥ Docker Deployment (Optional)
A docker-compose.yml file is included for containerized deployment:
shdocker-compose up -d
This will start:

Django application
Celery worker
Celery beat
Redis
